			There are two main categories of monkeys, (i) new world monkeys, and
			(ii) old world monkeys. The new world monkeys are found in the
			regions of South America and North America, whereas the old world
			monkeys are found in the Asian countries and the African region.
			Most of the monkeys are mostly found sleeping while sitting on the
			trees, balancing on a single branch and resting their bottoms
			upright on the branch. According to research, the sleepiest species
			of monkey can sleep for 15-17 hours. The difference between the new
			world monkey and the old world monkey is that the nose of the new
			world monkey has a round shape, whereas the nose of the old world
			monkey has a small curve. The new world monkeys do not have any
			cheek pouches to store food, whereas the old world monkeys have
			cheek pouches which are used to store food.
